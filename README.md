# MJO-Tools

This is a curated archive of internal tools developed for Manhattan Justice Opportunities (MJO), a court-based alternative-to-incarceration program in New York City.

The tools were built to reduce manual overhead, streamline daily court operations, and improve service delivery to justice-involved participants. This repo is structured to support both internal handoff and as a public-facing portfolio of low-code systems work.

## Structure

- `dashboard/`  
  The MJO Dashboard: a centralized AppSheet web app used by 35+ staff members to coordinate daily operations and client care.

- `scripts/`  
  A collection of Google Apps Script automations powering case tracking, report generation, and data parsing.

- `media/`  
  Demo videos, diagrams, and visual aids for understanding how the systems work.
