# MJO Dashboard

This repository documents the full AppSheet-based **MJO Dashboard**, an internal tool built to support daily office operations at Manhattan Justice Opportunities.

The dashboard serves as a centralized platform for staff to manage client appointments, track participant flow, fulfill phone requests, access resources, and coordinate real-time tasks â€” all from a single interface. It integrates with Slack and AcuityScheduling to push and pull appointment information as well as send messages based on business logic.
