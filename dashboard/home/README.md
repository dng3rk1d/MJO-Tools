# üè† Home View

The **Home** view serves as the central operational dashboard for daily office operations, providing staff with a real-time overview of appointments, participant check-ins, and front desk workflows. This dashboard dynamically displays the current date and consolidates multiple data streams to create a comprehensive view of daily activities.

## Purpose & Overview

The Home view functions as the primary landing screen for staff, designed to streamline daily client interactions and provide immediate visibility into scheduled appointments and walk-ins. It integrates with AcuityScheduling API to pull real-time appointment data and features automated workflows that connect appointment management to participant logging systems.

Key capabilities include:
- **Real-time appointment calendar** with integrated check-in functionality
- **Automated notifications** via Slack webhooks for team coordination
- **Walk-in rotation assignment** built into the Sign in form, making it easy for reception to assign clients to the right practitioners 

## Sign In & Check In Workflows

The Home view supports two primary methods for managing participant arrivals, each designed for different scenarios:

### Quick Check In Action
The **Quick Check In** button appears directly within the appointment calendar for scheduled visits. When staff click this action, it automatically creates a new entry in the Participant Log table with pre-populated information from the appointment (participant name, appointment type, case manager, and notes). This streamlined process reduces friction during busy periods by eliminating manual data entry and immediately routing participants to the "Waiting Area" status.

### Sign In Form (Walk-ins)
For participants arriving without scheduled appointments, the **Sign In** navigation action routes staff to a dedicated form at the front desk. This comprehensive workflow captures detailed participant information and visit reasons, making it ideal for walk-in scenarios that require more context.

## Slack Integration

Both check-in methods trigger automated Slack notifications in the in-office channel:

- The **Quick Check In** button sends a notification using the appointment‚Äôs details with one click.
- The **Sign In** form collects manual input by the receptionist, then sends a similar notification upon submission.

In both cases, if a case manager is assigned, the system tags them in a thread under the original Slack message. This ensures the team is immediately aware of participant arrivals and who‚Äôs responsible for follow-up.
