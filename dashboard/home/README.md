# üè† Home View

The **Home** view is the default landing screen for staff, designed as a central dashboard for daily court operations. It dynamically displays the current date and aggregates multiple subviews that reflect real-time information on participants, appointments, and internal workflows.

## üìé Notes

- This dashboard is used live in court every day.
- The Quick Check In action reduces friction by automatically logging arrivals with a timestamp and routing them to the "Waiting Area" flow.
- The confirmation prompt helps prevent mis-clicks during rapid client check-ins.
