# üè† Home View

The **Home** view serves as the central operational dashboard for daily office operations, providing staff with a real-time overview of appointments, participant check-ins, and front desk workflows. This dashboard dynamically displays the current date and consolidates multiple data streams to create a comprehensive view of daily activities.

## Purpose & Overview

The Home view functions as the primary landing screen for staff, designed to streamline daily client interactions and provide immediate visibility into scheduled appointments and walk-ins. It integrates with AcuityScheduling API to pull real-time appointment data and features automated workflows that connect appointment management to participant logging systems.

Key capabilities include:
- **Real-time appointment calendar** with integrated check-in functionality
- **Quick action buttons** for common front desk operations
- **Dynamic date display** that updates automatically throughout the day
- **Seamless workflow integration** connecting appointments to participant tracking
- **Automated notifications** via Slack webhooks for team coordination

## Sign In & Check In Workflows

The Home view supports two primary methods for managing participant arrivals, each designed for different scenarios:

### Quick Check In Action
The **Quick Check In** button appears directly within the appointment calendar for scheduled visits. When staff click this action, it automatically creates a new entry in the Participant Log table with pre-populated information from the appointment (participant name, appointment type, case manager, and notes). This streamlined process reduces friction during busy periods by eliminating manual data entry and immediately routing participants to the "Waiting Area" status.

### Sign In Form (Walk-ins)
For participants arriving without scheduled appointments, the **Sign In** navigation action routes staff to a dedicated form at the front desk. This comprehensive workflow captures detailed participant information and visit reasons, making it ideal for walk-in scenarios that require more context.

## Slack Integration

Both check-in methods trigger automated Slack notifications to keep the team informed of participant arrivals:

- **Scheduled appointments** (Quick Check In): Notifications are sent to the office channel when participants check in for their appointments
- **Walk-in participants** (Sign In form): When a case manager is assigned during sign-in, the system sends a notification to the in-office channel and tags the specific case manager in a thread

This integration ensures that case managers are immediately aware when their participants arrive, whether for scheduled appointments or unexpected visits.
